# Food-drive
The Edmonton City Food Drive project uses machine learning to make managing food donations in Edmonton, Alberta, more efficient. It focuses on improving the way food is collected and delivered by creating better plans for drop-offs and pick-ups. It also works on optimizing the routes for volunteers and making sure resources like vehicles and manpower are used wisely. The goal is to ensure the entire food drive runs more smoothly and effectively, helping to collect and distribute more donations. This project will help us make the food drive more effective and beneficial for the community. 
Our aim for this project is to develop a machine learning model to identify the optimal drop-off locations by analyzing geographic spread and donation density. The project aims to set up an automated system that assigns and improves the pick-up routes based on the area and the count of donations to make the process more effective.  Use the insights derived from the project to predict future donation patterns and adjust strategies for ongoing improvement.  Improve communication and coordination between Regional Coordinators, Stake Food Drive Representatives, and Ward Food Drive Representatives to make operations run more smoothly.
